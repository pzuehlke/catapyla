    "is perfectly balanced, so that each outcome is equally likely, then the\n",
    "_probability distribution_ on our sample space is the function $ f \\colon \\Omega\n",
    "\\to [0, 1] $ that assigns the value $ \\frac{1}{6} $ to each face.  Actually,\n",
    "this is a very special distribution called the _uniform distribution_.  However,\n",
    "in practice the die will never be perfectly balanced, so that some outcomes\n",
    "(faces) may be more probable than others. It is the purpose of the probability\n",

    "\n",
    "The preceding example illustrates a _finite_ sample space. However, many\n",

    "the sample space will occur is certain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. (_Countable Additivity_) For any countable or finite sequence of mutually\n",
    "exclusive events $ A_1, A_2, A_3, \\ldots $ (meaning no two events have any\n",

    "Formally, a __sample space__ is a pair consisting of a set $ \\Omega $ and\n",

    "Usually a sample space is described not in terms of the probability function\n",
